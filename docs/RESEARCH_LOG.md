## 2025-06-16 - Conversation Analysis Framework

### Research Context
37 citizen consultation interviews from Uruguay (May 28-29, 2025) analyzing national and local priorities through systematic qualitative research.

### Annotation Framework
- **Multi-level Analysis**: Interview-level (themes, priorities) + Turn-level (conversation dynamics)
- **XML Schema**: Comprehensive annotation structure in `config/prompts/annotation-prompt-en.xml`
- **Priority Categories**: Security, education, healthcare, community concerns
- **Evidence Types**: Personal experience, observation, hearsay, expert knowledge

### Conversation Analysis Methodology
- **Speaker Identification**: Pattern recognition for interview participants (AM, CR, JP, etc.)
- **Turn Segmentation**: Systematic parsing of conversation flow
- **Discourse Analysis**: Word counts, speaker distribution, interaction patterns

### Key Research Findings
From test interview (058 - Centro Esperanza Young):
- **Participants**: 6 speakers across 405 conversation turns
- **Topic Focus**: Disability services, institutional financing, government support
- **Conversation Dynamics**: 
  - JP (Director): 117 turns, 3,265 words (most active)
  - CR (Interviewer): 112 turns, 1,502 words
  - SL (President): 107 turns, 2,297 words
  - Balanced participation across stakeholders

### Research Questions Emerging
1. How do conversation dynamics reflect power structures in citizen consultations?
2. What patterns emerge in priority articulation across different speaker roles?
3. How can turn-level analysis inform digital twin conversation modeling?

### Methodological Innovations
- **Dual-Layer Approach**: Combining AI annotation with conversation parsing
- **Digital Twin Preparation**: Structured conversation data for future modeling
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing framework validates parsing accuracy

### Data Quality Observations
- Spanish language processing challenges (accent characters, speaker normalization)
- Speaker pattern consistency across interviews
- Need for validation across diverse interview formats
