## 2025-06-16 21:45 - Conversation Parsing & Pipeline Integration

### Overview
Implemented end-to-end conversation parsing system to extract structured turn-level data from interview transcripts for digital twin research capabilities.

### Technical Changes
- **Pipeline Enhancement**: Modified `src/pipeline/full_pipeline.py` to store raw interview text during ingestion
- **Conversation Parser**: Created `src/pipeline/parsing/conversation_parser.py` with speaker pattern recognition
- **Database Schema**: Added Turn model and related tables for conversation storage
- **Dashboard Integration**: Built conversation flow visualization in Streamlit dashboard

### Key Implementation Details
```python
# ConversationParser extracts structured turns from raw text
parser = ConversationParser()
turns = parser.parse_conversation(raw_text)  # 405 turns from test interview

# Pipeline now stores both raw text and parsed conversations
repo.save_extracted_data(extracted_data, xml_content=xml_string, raw_text=interview.text)
```

### Testing Framework
- Implemented proper pytest-based testing structure (`tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`)
- Created test runner: `python run_tests.py pipeline`
- Found real issues: Spanish/English speaker normalization, word count accuracy

### Database Schema Updates
- `Turn` model: turn_number, speaker, text, word_count
- `ConversationRepository`: turn storage and retrieval
- Automatic conversation parsing during pipeline execution

### Performance Results
- Parsed 405 conversation turns from test interview (20250528_0900_058.txt)
- 6 speakers identified: AM, CR, JP, PM, SL, MS
- 8,049 total words across conversation
- Average 19.9 words per turn

### Issues Resolved
- **Raw text storage**: Pipeline now preserves original interview text in database
- **Session management**: Fixed SQLAlchemy session issues in dashboard
- **Turn-level analysis**: Enables future digital twin conversation reconstruction

### Next Steps
- Validate conversation parsing across more interviews
- Enhance speaker identification for complex transcripts
- Add conversation metrics to dashboard analytics

## 2025-06-16 22:30 - Testing Framework Issues Fixed

### Issues Resolved
- **Pytest Configuration**: Added missing `database` and `e2e` markers to pytest.ini
- **Spanish Localization**: Fixed conversation parser to use Spanish speaker terms ("Participante" not "Participant")
- **Word Count Accuracy**: Corrected test expectations for Spanish accent characters
- **SQLAlchemy Warning**: Updated to use `sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base` instead of deprecated import

### Test Results After Fixes
```bash
# Core pipeline verification - ALL TESTS PASSING ✅
python run_tests.py pipeline
# Result: 21/21 tests passed

# Individual component testing
pytest tests/unit/test_conversation_parser.py -v
# Result: 10/10 tests passed

pytest tests/unit/test_document_processor.py -v  
# Result: 11/11 tests passed
```

### Testing Framework Status
- **Unit Tests**: All core component tests passing (conversation parser, document processor)
- **Integration Tests**: Some failures due to missing API keys/database (expected)
- **E2E Tests**: Framework functional, some tests require external dependencies
- **Test Runner**: `python run_tests.py pipeline` provides reliable verification

### Technical Details
**Speaker Normalization Fix:**
```python
# Before (caused test failures)
"participante" -> "Participant" 

# After (correct Spanish localization)  
"participante" -> "Participante"
```

**Word Count Accuracy:**
- Spanish text "Esta es una frase de exactamente ocho palabras aquí" = 9 words (not 8)
- Test updated to match actual word count including accent characters

**Pytest Configuration:**
```ini
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests  
    e2e: End-to-end tests for complete workflows
    database: Tests requiring database connectivity
    slow: Tests that take a long time to run
    requires_api: Tests that require API keys
```

### Current Testing Capability
The testing framework now provides reliable verification that the end-to-end pipeline works correctly on small data subsets, with all core component tests passing and proper Spanish language support.

## 2025-06-17 00:15 - Database Integration Tests Completed

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive database integration tests to verify SQL database generation and querying functionality, ensuring all CRUD operations and repository patterns work correctly.

### Database Test Implementation
Created `tests/integration/test_database.py` with extensive test coverage:

**Test Classes:**
- `TestDatabaseSchema`: Verifies table creation, CRUD operations, conversation turns storage
- `TestRepositoryIntegration`: Tests repository patterns with ConversationRepository and ExtractedDataRepository
- `TestDatabaseQueries`: Complex aggregation queries, priority analysis, interview-priority joins

### Key Technical Fixes

**Import Resolution:**
```python
# Fixed import conflict between dataclass and SQLAlchemy model
from src.database.models import Priority as PriorityModel
from src.pipeline.extraction.data_extractor import Priority as PriorityData
```

**Repository Pattern Consistency:**
```python
# Updated InterviewRepository to accept both db_connection and session
def __init__(self, db_connection=None, session=None):
    self.db_connection = db_connection
    self.session = session
```

**Required Field Validation:**
- Fixed NOT NULL constraint on `priorities.description` field
- Added missing `annotation_timestamp` parameter to ExtractedData construction
- Ensured all test data includes required fields

### Test Results
All 9 database integration tests now pass:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_database.py -v
# Result: 9/9 tests passed ✅
```

**Test Coverage Includes:**
- ✅ Database schema creation (all 12 tables)
- ✅ Interview CRUD operations  
- ✅ Conversation turns storage and retrieval
- ✅ Priority and theme management
- ✅ Repository pattern functionality
- ✅ Complex aggregation queries
- ✅ Multi-table joins and relationships

### Verified Functionality
- **SQL Database Generation**: All tables create correctly with proper constraints
- **Data Storage**: Interview, Turn, Priority, Theme models store/retrieve properly  
- **Repository Pattern**: ExtractedDataRepository, ConversationRepository work correctly
- **Query Operations**: Aggregations, joins, filtering all function as expected
- **Relationship Integrity**: Foreign keys and backref relationships work properly

### Pipeline Integration Status
Core pipeline tests continue to pass (21/21) confirming database changes don't break existing functionality.

## 2025-06-17 00:45 - Database Query Capabilities Verified

### Overview
Created comprehensive integration tests to verify that the SQL database supports all required access patterns for individual interviews, conditional turn filtering, and complex multi-table queries.

### Test Implementation
Created `tests/integration/test_database_queries.py` with 20 tests across 5 test classes:

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ **Individual Interview Access** (4 tests): By ID, date, department, participant count
- ✅ **Turn Conditional Filtering** (5 tests): By interview, speaker, word count, keywords, complex conditions  
- ✅ **Interview-Turn Relationships** (3 tests): Eager loading, backref navigation, aggregation statistics
- ✅ **Complex Multi-Table Queries** (3 tests): Priority/theme joins, education analysis, speaker participation
- ✅ **Advanced Filtering & Aggregation** (5 tests): Department stats, priority frequency, confidence filtering, turn sequences, date ranges

### Key Verified Capabilities

**Individual Interview Access:**
```python
# Get specific interview
interview = session.query(Interview).filter(
    Interview.interview_id == "INT_001"
).first()

# Filter by date/department/participants
interviews = session.query(Interview).filter(
    Interview.date == "2025-05-28",
    Interview.department == "Montevideo"
).all()
```

**Conditional Turn Access:**
```python
# Turns for specific interview with conditions
turns = session.query(Turn).join(Interview).filter(
    and_(
        Interview.interview_id == "INT_002",
        Turn.speaker == "Participante",
        Turn.word_count >= 5
    )
).all()

# Keyword search in turn text
education_turns = session.query(Turn).filter(
    Turn.text.contains("educación")
).all()
```

**Complex Aggregations:**
```python
# Turn statistics per interview
stats = session.query(
    Interview.interview_id,
    func.count(Turn.id).label('turn_count'),
    func.sum(Turn.word_count).label('total_words')
).join(Turn).group_by(Interview.id).all()
```

**Multi-Table Relationships:**
```python
# Eager load related data
interviews = session.query(Interview).options(
    joinedload(Interview.turns),
    joinedload(Interview.priorities),
    joinedload(Interview.themes)
).all()
```

### Test Results
All 20 database query tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Can access individual interviews with various filters
- ✅ Can query turns with complex conditions (speaker, content, word count)
- ✅ Can perform aggregations across interview-turn relationships
- ✅ Can execute multi-table joins with priorities and themes
- ✅ Can filter by confidence levels, date ranges, and speaker patterns

### Database Access Patterns Confirmed
The SQL database fully supports the required access patterns for qualitative research analysis, including conversation turn analysis, priority tracking, and thematic coding retrieval with flexible filtering and aggregation capabilities.
